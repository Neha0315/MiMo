Plenty of living space. Sophisticated contemporary architecture. A great location - with skyline views all around you. And a single-family home that has the unbeatable convenience of an attached double garage and ...and 13 years of full tax abatement! A really great floor plan begins on the first level with a gracious foyer and a corner office whose large windows look straight up Superior Avenue. It takes the idea of a home-office to a new level. And the 1st floor guest room has its own ensuite bath. The stairs lead up to a spectacular main floor with high ceilings and wall-sized windows on three sides. The kitchen has a dramatic center island with waterfall quartzite counters, loads of cabinets and a huge walk-in pantry. Every part of the space, with the dining room right in the middle, has its own piece of the downtown views. The living area has an elegant fireplace and wonderful corner windows. It's a house that breaks all the townhouse rules of long, narrow and dark. The spaces are wide and bright, with views from every room. There's a large terrace right off the kitchen, as perfect for a party as it is for coffee every morning. On the 3rd floor there are two bedrooms, a master suite with an elegant bath and a large walk-in closet. The 3rd bedroom is on the front corner, with amazing views. The 4th floor is the most dramatic space in the house, with stunning views in every direction, and an oversize rooftop deck that has some of the best views downtown - from Playhouse Square to Public Square.
